# Graph
An implementation for the graph data structure along with implementation of common graph algorithms.
An abstract base class Graph is used to model a graph.
The derived classes DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph inherit from class Graph.

Currently added features:
   1. Create a Graph with N vertices.
   2. Add an unweighted edge between two vertices u,v.
   3. Add a weighted edge between two vertices u,v.
   4. Traverse the Graph using BFS or DFS.
   5. Check if the Graph is cyclic. 
   6. Get the strongly connected components of a Directed Graph.
